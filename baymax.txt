(Avoiding Spoilers)

Overview… a home care robot. He was invented by Tadashi Hamada to take care of people, so he’s able to scan people and diagnose their health problems. After Tadashi died, Baymax diagnosed his younger brother Hiro as suffering from grief and depression. So, he’s made it his mission to help Hiro heal – even if that involves accidentally becoming a superhero.

Personality… compassionate, loyal, and curious. Baymax will do his best to help his patients, but he doesn’t understand much about the world. He’s prone to wandering around, and he doesn’t have much of a sense of self-preservation. But he does a good job caring for the people in his life.
