Character Analysis

(Avoiding Spoilers)

Grew up… on Earth, centuries in the future. A robot that functions as a automated trash compactor, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth-Class) was created in 2105 to help clean up a seriously polluted Earth . However, after their efforts fail, Earth's humans evacuated and shut down all the cleaning robots. All, of course, except WALL-E.

Living… alone, except for his best (and only) friend, a cockroach named Hal. Despite the isolation, WALL-E isn't lonely; with mountains of trash still covering Earth, it's easy enough for a robot to amuse himself.

Profession…  the last garbage man (er, robot?) in an abandoned, deserted world. However, that all changes when a spaceship abruptly lands and releases a sleek probe named EVE to look for plant life. WALL-E instantly falls in love with her. After EVE discovers a seedling in WALL-E's shed, the lonely little robot is in for the ride of his life.

Interests… cleaning up the world, finding EVE, and investigating all things human. WALL-E's love of human artifacts is undeniable, though his taste in objects is rather...unconventional. But while WALL-E chooses rubber ducks and Rubik's Cubes over diamond rings, he is deeply human in a major sense: his desire for that elusive, mysterious thing called love.
