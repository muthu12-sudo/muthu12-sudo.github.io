Character Analysis

(Avoiding Spoilers)

Overview...a robot on a mission. As an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, EVE was created for one goal: to see if Earth–which is currently a polluted wasteland­–is finally capable of supporting life. Armed with a plasma cannon and other state-of-the-art technology, EVE arrives on Earth ready to search for plant life—only to find a little more than she'd bargained for.   

Personality...no-nonsense, driven, and competent. EVE was built for one purpose and initially, all she of her focus is on that one directive. But after spending time with robot WALL-E, EVE starts to learn that there's more to life than orders and goals—like love, for one.
