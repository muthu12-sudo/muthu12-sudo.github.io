Omnitrix concept design as used by Ben 10 franchise]]
The '''Omnitrix''', its [[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien#The Ultimatrix|Ultimatrix]] replacement, and the "finalized" version that is the [[Ben 10: Omniverse#The New Omnitrix|New Omnitrix]] are the central elements of the ''Ben 10'' story. They are all [[wristwatch]]-styled devices developed by the Galvan inventor [[Azmuth]] that transforms the user into [[List of Ben 10 aliens|any one of many alien beings]] (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct.

The Omnitrix appears in the first two incarnations of the franchise (''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''), but Ben had to destroy it and use the Ultimatrix in the ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]'' series. The Ultimatrix had most of the same functionality as the Omnitrix, but would allow the user to transform the alien into its Ultimate Form (how the species and its DNA would evolve in a one-million-year simulation). In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix{{spaced ndash}}the original version has been a prototype.

In ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse]]'', the [[Ben 10: Omniverse#The Nemetrix|Nemetrix]], a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of sentient alien races which have the sole purpose of hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are unable to use it without incurring mental damage. In ''Omniverse'', Albedo recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms.

In ''[[Ben 10 (2016 TV series)|the Reboot series]]'', Ben's Omnitrix can augment enhancements onto his aliens. In Season 2, his aliens can become "Omni-Enhanced" with rock-like constructs and energy. However, the enhancements seems to happen at random. This energy is later revealed to be coming from a new alien species in his Omnitrix, which eventually gets its own form, "Shock Rock". In Season 4, Ben unlocks the "Omni-Kix" feature, which allows him to add armor plating onto his aliens. 
The Reboot series also introduces the Antitrix, which is wielded by Kevin Levin. The Antitrix allows Kevin to transform into 11 aliens, most of which are ones that Ben has used before, but significantly altered from Ben's version.
