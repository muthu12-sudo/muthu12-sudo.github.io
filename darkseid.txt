(Avoiding Spoilers)

Living… with huge muscles and piercing eyes that can destroy enemies with lasers. 

Profession… conqueror. Darkseid is the ruler of the planet Apokolips and controls the Parademon army. He has already taken over many planets and murdered many, but it is never enough for him. Darkseid now has his sights set on Earth. Darkseid wants to expand his tyrannical influence as it is in his nature as conqueror to never be content with what he has. He hates the Justice League, as he sees them as annoying pests that are messing with his plans for complete domination. But with Superman gone, Darkseid doesn’t believe there is anyone on Earth capable of defeating him. 

Challenge… finding the Anti-Life Equation, which destroys all free will and is the key to his ruling the universe. Darkseid will go to extreme lengths to find it: “I have turned one hundred thousand worlds to dust looking for Anti-Life; looking for those who robbed me of my glory. I will stride across their bones and bask in the glow of Anti-Life, and all of existence shall be mine!”

Personality… cold, determined, and arrogant. Darkseid exhibits a relentless desire for the equation and will stop at nothing until he finds it. He is a ruthless leader who doesn’t care if he loses many of his troops, as long as he gets what he wants in the end.
