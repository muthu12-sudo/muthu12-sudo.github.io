(Avoiding Spoilers)

Living... with Andy, the human boy who owns Woody and his friends. Among Andy's toys, Woody is the definite favorite — a title he wears with pride, but one which Woody refuses to let affect how he treats his fellow toys.

Profession... wild west sheriff. Woody takes to leadership well and does everything in his power to ensure his fellow toys' safety and happiness.

Interests... playing with Andy, keeping his community safe, and making sure his friends are happy. Andy's affection means the world to Woody, and he'll do anything possible to make sure his “boy” is happy. As he puts it: "It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us."

Relationship Status... single. But Woody and the pretty, porcelain Bo Peep bashfully flirt with one another from time to time.

Challenge... dealing with recent changes in his community. Not only are Andy and his family moving soon — an ordeal rife with the potential to get lost or misplaced — but Woody now has to deal with Buzz Lightyear, a snazzy new action figure who is quickly replacing Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Faced with this high-tech hellion, the old-fashioned Woody has to despairingly ask, "What chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?"

Personality... responsible, competent, and level-headed. Deeply devoted to his friends, Woody is the leader of Andy's toys for good reason. While Buzz's sudden popularity may try Woody's patience, it never causes him to abandon his sense of duty, and Woody will not hesitate to jump to a fellow toy's defense.
